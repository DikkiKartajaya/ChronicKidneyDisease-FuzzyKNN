# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction using Fuzzy KNN

## Overview :
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting chronic kidney disease (CKD) using the Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbors (Fuzzy KNN) algorithm. Chronic kidney disease is a significant health concern globally, and early detection plays a crucial role in effective management and treatment. Machine learning techniques, particularly Fuzzy KNN, offer a promising approach for accurate prediction.

## Methodology:
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables if necessary.
2. Feature Selection: Identifying relevant features that contribute significantly to the prediction of CKD.
3. Model Training: Implementing the Fuzzy k-NN algorithm using scikit-fuzzy library.
4. Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
